## Content instructions

This website is under construction. It is based on Markdown syntax runned with Jekyll on Github serveres.

With simple markdown files it is possible to display webpages with 

- [links](https://www.google.fr)
- ![image](https://picsum.photos/seed/picsum/536/354)
- etc.

Is this a rounded corner button: {[(*words*)]} ???
